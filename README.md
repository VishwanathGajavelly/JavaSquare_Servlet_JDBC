This is My website which is yet to be deployed and a lot more to be done. Currently I'm ready with just a Feedback form. Server side is being managed by Java Servlets, connected to Oracle Database. Front End Technologies used: HTML, CSS.

### To be developed: 
1. SpringMVC and Hibernate connections.
2. Fill the pages with content.
3. Never Ending User Interface improvements.

#### Advancements expected:
1. Have plans to develop a Single Page Application using Angular JS, will start as soon as I'm done with the developments in this project.
